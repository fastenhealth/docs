# Corp

- [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) to incorporate?
  - **Why?** It's not my primary priority, but I am hesitant to sign healthcare provider TOS and agreements under my name. 
  - Stripe Atlas's registration fees seem pretty reasonable. 
    - $500/y1, $100/y after 
      > Starting a company in Delaware is largely picking a name, picking an agent, and filing a form with payment. 
      > The recurring costs relate to paying your agent, paying your accountant, and paying Delaware its $300/year. 
      > (Technically you can do the accountant part yourself if you don't have income (and it is not included in the Stripe plan), 
      > but the agent part needs to be someone with a physical address in Delaware)

Corps aren't just more work, they require more knowledge about what you are doing. You are a shareholder, officer, and 
director and each has liabilities and obligations. I can't just tell you what those are because the answer is going to 
be a lot of "it depends". You may be fine, but it can also be an expensive mess.
At the end of the day do what makes you comfortable, as you can be successful with either, and can be well protected with 
either. Just be careful about where you get your advice as there is a lot of just wrong information people take as true on the internet.
